hycohanz
========

hycohanz is an Open Source (BSD license) Python wrapper interface 
to the ANSYS HFSS Windows COM API, enabling you to control HFSS 
from Python.

Warning
-------

hycohanz is pre-alpha software.  The interfaces can be expected to 
break constantly.  If you are looking for a stable, reliable 
function library for HFSS, you must look elsewhere for now.

Contributing

Often one finds that this library is missing a wrapper for a particular 
function.  Fortunately it's often quite easy to add, usually taking 
only a few minutes.  Most of the time it's a quick modification of 
an existing function.  Many functions can be implemented in five 
lines of code or less.  If you do add a feature to the code, please 
consider contributing it back to this project.
