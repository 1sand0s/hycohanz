hycohanz
========

hycohanz is an Open Source (BSD-licensed) Python wrapper interface to the ANSYS HFSS Windows COM API, simplifying control of HFSS from Python.

Minimal Example
---------------

.. sourcecode:: python

	import hycohanz as hfss

	[oAnsoftApp, oDesktop] = hfss.setup_interface()

	raw_input('Press "Enter" to quit HFSS.>')

	hfss.quit_application(oDesktop)

	del oDesktop
	del oAnsoftApp


Quick Install
-------------

Installation is easy if you already have HFSS, Python, and the pywin32 Python package:

1. Download the .zip file from Github:  https://mradway.github.com/hycohanz

2. Unzip to a convenient location.

3. At the Windows command shell prompt, run::

    > C:\Python27\python setup.py install

See :ref:`detailed-install` if you don't already have Python installed.
