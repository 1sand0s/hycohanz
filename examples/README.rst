Examples
========

In this directory are a number of very simple example scripts.  Basically, each script is intended to highlight basic usage of a single hycohanz_ function given by the name of the script itself.  This is intended to make it easy for one to find an example script for an unfamiliar function.  

.. _hycohanz:  http://mradway.github.io/hycohanz/

If you find a script that doesn't work and you believe it's a bug, please create an issue in the `issue tracker`_.  Likewise, if you find a hycohanz function that doesn't have an example here, the issue tracker is a great place to report it.  Of course, if you just want to email_ it to me directly, that's fine too.  And of course, if you've written an example yourself we'd like to see it!
